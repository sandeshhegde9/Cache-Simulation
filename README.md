# Cache-Simulation
This program simulates the working of a cache memory. 
Gives hit rates for a given sequence of memory access. Cache size, no. of sets in cache,
no. of lines in each line, block size can be varied by varying the lavues of global variables.
The mat_mult.c generates memory access sequence for matrix multiplication program.
